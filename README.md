# ITEB: iterated & truncated empirical bayes for strong signal detection

In the file z_scores.R, we provide four functions to use.

iteratedEB: estimation using iterated & truncated empirical bayes and out put estimated tau

truncatedMLE: estimation using the truncated MLE and out put estimated tau

Az_scores_ITEB: get the tau using iteratedEB and the associated p-values

Az_scores_TMLE: get the tau using truncatedMLE and the associated p-values
