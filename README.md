# ITEB: iterated & truncated empirical bayes for strong signal detection

In the file z_scores.R, we provide two functions to use, and they provide the estimate of tau and z-scores using different methods:

ITEB: estimation using iterated & truncated empirical bayes


truncatedMLE: estimation using the truncated MLE
